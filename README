This is a simple bot intended to be a flexible skeleton for "real" bots.

Run it with "racket bot.rkt", and it will barf at the lack of
configuration file and will tell you where to create it and what to put
in.

For more convenient running, use "run" to run the above in a loop, or
use "gabot.service" with systemd to have it running as a service.  The
main directory for extensions is "handlers", see some samples there.
There no proper documentation or a more useful README file, but it would
be nice to have them.
